<h3>Description</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix is indeed naughty! This time he did something mischievous.
  Jelix did not tidy up the legos he had played and left them on the floor.
  Seeing this, Jelix's parents scolded Jelix and ordered him to tidy up immediately.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We can represent those legos in a two-dimensional grid where each cell contains a lego.
  Formally if there is a lego located in $(x, y)$, then the legos adjacent to it are in $(x+1, y)$, 
  $(x-1, y)$, $(x, y+1)$, and $(x, y-1)$.
  Two legos are alike if they have the same color.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  When he wants to tidy his legos, he saw that among those scattered legos, legos that are alike 
  form strange shapes.
  A strange shape is defined as two-dimensional figure consisting of alike legos that are adjacent 
  horizontally or vertically.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A strange shape can be found several times in different orientations by rotating them 90 degrees.
  The following is an example of some shapes and all of their orientations.
  Shapes colored in one color are the same shape.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix wants to find the number of strange shapes that he can find from the scattered legos.
  But due to being rushed to tidy them, he ask your help as a reliable coder.
  Don't worry, Jelix has given you a rough picture of the legos' positions and colors!

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first line consists of an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 20$) that determines the number 
  of test cases.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, the first line consists of two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \leq R, C \leq 50$) 
  that determine the size of the two-dimensional grid representing Jelix's legos.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The next $R$ lines consist of $C$ integers $A_y$ ($1 \leq A_y \leq 100$) that determine the color 
  of each legos on the grid.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output <code>Case #X: Y</code>. <code>X</code> represents the case number 
  (starting from 1), and <code>Y</code> represents the number of strange shapes.
</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first test case has 4 different shapes shown as follows (one strange shape are given 
  the same color):
